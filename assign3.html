   <p> I am a Political Science Major at Southern Virginia University. However, I dislike the thought of actually working in that field.
   </p>
   <p> For this reason, I am considering adding a Computer Science Major, which could open some new and exciting fields to me. To that end,
   I have taken/am taking these classes: </p>
 <ol>
   <li> Fundamentals of Programming </li>
   <li> Data Structures </li>
   <li> Authoring for the Web </li>


 </ol>
 <p>
   My ideal career would be in one of the following areas:
  </p>
 <ul>
   <li> Programming Legislative Websites</li>
   <li> Cyber Security </li>
   <li> Working on the forefront of new technologies </li>
 </ul>
